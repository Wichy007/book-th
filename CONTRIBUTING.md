## Translation
1. Please translate one chapter at a time from top to bottom. Jumping the translation between the context in the same chapter will make the other translator lose the context in the original language around the part that not translate yet.
3. When do the translation, please change only the texts and keep the style as same as the original version.
4. Keep transliteration words low, but if you think Thai word to describe that English word is not clear as the original one, you can decide to keep it untouched.
5. When in doubt, use the existing translation as the guideline.

## Submitting a pull request
